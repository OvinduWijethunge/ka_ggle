1. data analysis part
2. feature engineering part
3. feature selection part
4. model building part
5. deployment


--------------------------------------DATA ANALYSIS PART-----------------------------------

 MAin aim is to understand more about the data
 here we dont change our dataset we use a copy of data set to when we are doing data analyzis
 here our main target is by exploring dataset find the realtionships...make conclutions ....plans what to do in feature engineering part

In Data Analysis We will Analyze To Find out the below stuff
1.Missing Values
2.All The Numerical Variables
3.Distribution of the Numerical Variables
4.Categorical Variables
5.Cardinality of Categorical Variables
6.Outliers
7.Relationship between independent and dependent feature(SalePrice)

  here wwe just count the missing values in each columns ..not handle ...handking doin in feature engineering phase.
  take a misssing value columns list
  since they are many missing values, we need to find the relationship between missing values and Sales Price
  we have to group by using relevent feature and draw bar charts (categorical) with respective dependant feature
  we ned to find the what are the numerical featurs nd count of numerical features
  take a list of numerical variables
  check whether you have Temporal Variables(Eg: Datetime Variables) and find the realtionship between each temporal feature 
  with respective dependant feature
  get a year_feature list(year_feature = [feature for feature in numerical_features if 'Yr' in feature or 'Year' in feature])
  then draw some graphs (scatter flot)
  get discrete feature list (you can derived from numerical list)
  Find the realtionship between them and Sale PRice draw bar chart
  get continuous feature list (you can derived from numerical list)
  Find the realtionship between them and Sale PRice draw histogram 
  We will be using logarithmic transformation and respective dependant feature
  cheack weaather there are outliers (draw box plot)
  take acategorical feature list
  find the cardinallaty of categorical features
  Find out the relationship between categorical variable and dependent feature SalesPrice (bar charts)


-------------------------------------------FEATURE ENGINEERING PART------------------------------------------------------


here we basically make up our data set for readable to model

1. handle missing values
    *numerical
    *categorical
2. handle temporal values
3. handle categorical values
4. transformation---logarathimic
4. scaling



always remember there way always be a chance of data leakage so we need to split the data first and then apply feature
handle missing value for categoory feature
take categorical feature list with NAN values
converted NAN values in to a new category as 'missing' for every features
take numerical feature list with NAN values
in data analysis we saw lot of outlier ..so we replace with median not with mean
create a new feature to capture nan values (for get some more information by adding a new column)
replace nan values with its meadian value
take care temporal varibales (datetime variables)
Handling Rare Categorical Feature
We will give a new caegory label to a categorical variables that are present less than 1% of the observations
Transformation of features
Since the numerical variables are skewed we will perform log normal distribution
we dont do feature scale to id and our dependat featur
after feature scaling transform the train and test set, and add on the Id and SalePrice variables
data.to_csv('X_train.csv',index=False)
do same steps (analysis phase and feature engineering pahase ) to your test data file.




--------------------------------------------FEATURE SELECTION PART-----------------------------------------

take your data set which already preprocessed
Capture the dependent feature
y_train=dataset[['SalePrice']]
drop dependent feature from dataset
X_train=dataset.drop(['Id','SalePrice'],axis=1)
Apply Feature Selection
