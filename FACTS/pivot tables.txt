# compare survival rate across Age, SibSp, Parch, and Fare(numerical variables)
 
pd.pivot_table(training, index = 'Survived', values = ['Age','SibSp','Parch','Fare'], ,aggfunc ) 

	Age	Fare	Parch	SibSp
Survived				
0	30.626179	22.117887	0.329690	0.553734
1	28.343690	48.395408	0.464912	0.473684



here we can caluculate the average values of survivel people and dead people
as what is the avrage age /max age/ min age of survived people
as what is the avg ticket price of survived peple




# Comparing survival and each of these (categorical variables) here we take sex as our categorical variable 

pd.pivot_table(training, index = 'Survived', columns = 'Sex', values = 'PassengerId' ,aggfunc ='count')

Sex       female  male
Survived              
0             81   468
1            233   109




The first argument is just the dataframe containing our data.
values, is the one we want to apply the aggregating function on. For example, in this case we want to count the number of passengers (via PassengerId).
index, is the feature (or features) that we group by on the row axis. So the row labels of our table will be the unique values of this feature. In pivot1, it is age_bin.
columns, is the feature (or features) that we group by on the column axis. In pivot1, it is gender.
Finally, aggfunc is the function we apply to values. Here we apply count, but we can also apply count,sum, mean, min, max, or others.
