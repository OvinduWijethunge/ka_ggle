1. mean/median/mode replacement

   assumptions... data missed as completly at random
   solve this by replacing the NAN values by most frequent occurance of the variable
   disadvantages.... chnage the original variance

2. random sample imputation
   
   assumptions... data missed as completly at random
   take a random observation from dataset and we use this to replace NAN values
   advantages....... original variance not much chaged
   disadvantages...... this not work in every situations eg.. when NAN valeus ratio is high
   
3. capturing NAN values as a new feature

   it works when you have data not missed completly at random (MNAR)
   systemetic missing values
   advantages.... capture the importance of missing values
   disadvantages..... create a additional column (curse of dimensinality)

4. end of distribution imputation

   we can use this for see outlier
   in this scenario one would want to replace misssing data with values that are at the tail of the distributionof the 
   variable
   this makes dissapear the oitliers


5. arbitary imputation

   not frequntly using......
